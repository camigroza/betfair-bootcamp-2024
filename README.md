# Hotel booking system 
A simple application for managing hotel rooms and bookings.
I used the State Pattern to dynamically manage room states (available, reserved, checked-in, checked-out) and the Builder Pattern to simplify booking creation, allowing optional features like breakfast, dinner, spa, and airport pickup.

## Future improvements
These would include adding a User entity and implementing the Observer Pattern to enable a notification system. This would allow the admin to be notified whenever a room's state changes or a booking is created or canceled. Additionally, users would receive notifications when their bookings are successfully created or canceled.
